      <p> Hello there! I'm a recent computer science graduate from <a href="https://tec.mx/en/computer-science-and-information-technologies/bs-in-computer-science-and-technology?srsltid=AfmBOor8Aqo1c0-XTua4VAaKRkdIVf-8KKHU-Dzgb41QAhtHsGqh3QPF" target="_blank"><span>ITESM</span></a> 
        and a software engineer, with particular interst in machine learning and artificial intelligence. My current role is Junior AI Developer at <a href="https://www.capitalcertainty.com" target="_blank"><span>Capital Certainty</span></a>, where I use my skills in AI/ML and web 
        development to work with clients at enhancing and escalating their products. I'm passionate about learning new things and understanding how things really work. I never say no to a new challenge and pursue them constantly. I'm a firm believer of continuous growth and always 
        striving to be better every day. If you are interested in knowing more about my work, you can check out my <a href="work.html" target="_blank"><span>work</span></a> page.</p>
      <p>Outside of work, I consider myself to be a well-rounded person and could probably talk about almost anything, though my two main interests are reading and sports. When it comes to reading, I like to alternate between 
        fiction and non-fiction, with my favorite genres being science (and science fiction), neo-noir, and classic literature. If you want to know more about what I read, my Goodreads profile is <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/132694630-sotero-osuna " target="_blank">
        <span>here</span></a>. For sports, I am also versatile and have played a wide variety of them growing up, with basketball being my favorite and the one I've played the longest, even being part of the school's team up until high school. Nowadays, I have switched to 
        tennis and powerlifting with some running and hiking here and there. Though I do not play much basketball anymore, I still enjoy watching it and keep up with the NBA. It's also worth mentioning that I also love statistics and metrics that come from sports. I spend some of my
        free time keeping up with them and trying to find interesting insights.</p>
