      <p> Hello there! I'm Sot, Full-Stack SWE @ Google. Alongside my professional work, I have a strong passion for mathematics, machine learning and artificial intelligence, which I explore
        through ongoing study and personal projects. I'm driven by curiosity, enjoy taking on challenges, and believe in continous growth.
      <p>Outside of work, I enjoy reading and sports. I alternate between fiction and non-fiction, with favorites spanning science, science fiction, neo-noir, and classical literature. You can see my reading lists 
        <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/132694630-sotero-osuna " target="_blank"> <span>here</span></a>. Sports have always been a big part of my life–basketball was my first love and though I still follow the NBA, these days I'm more focused on 
        powerlifting, with some running and hiking on the side. I also love diving into sports metrics and statistics to uncover new insights.</p>
